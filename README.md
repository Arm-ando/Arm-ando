<h1> Hi there!👋</h1>
My name is Armando and I'm new to programming.. sort of! 

<h2>About me👨‍🔬</h2>
During my biomedical science undergraduate degree I was exposed to bioinformatics tools and coding, which left me wanting to explore more. I work in clinical research where I have been exposed to data manangement, and now have interest in pursuing a career working with data in the clinical research field.

<h3> Currently:</h3>
<p>🔭 I’ve recently completed a Python-focussed UK Department for Education-funded Software Engineering bootcamp. 
  
👨‍💻I am now studying independently to expand my knowledge and skillset by continuing to practice python, SQL and other bioinformatic tools. 

🪡I am in the processing of creating a pattern drafting program using python and SQL, due to my current love for sewing!
