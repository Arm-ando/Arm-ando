<h1> Hi there!👋</h1>
My name is Armando and I'm new to programming.. sort of! 

<h2>About me👨‍🔬</h2>
During my biomedical science undergraduate degree I was exposed to bioinformatics tools and coding, which left me wanting to explore more. I now work within clinical research where I have been exposed to data management.

<h3> Currently:</h3>
<p>🔭 I’ve recently completed a Python-focussed UK Department for Education-funded Software Engineering bootcamp. 
  
👨‍💻I am now studying independently to expand my knowledge and skillset by continuing to practice python, SQL and other bioinformatic tools. For now, I plan to build a database and more python programs!</p>
